# üè™ Totem Guide
## üßæ Overview
The **Totem** is a self-service, automated parking ticket vending machine designed to offer users a fast, intuitive, and app-free ticketing experience in designated parking zones.
Totems are especially helpful for visitors and non-registered users who prefer not to use mobile apps for parking.

The Totem provides a **contactless, account-free** alternative for purchasing tickets.

A **Totem** is a smart, touch-enabled kiosk or terminal installed in parking zones. It connects directly to the parking management system and allows users to:

- Purchase parking tickets
- Make payments via **contactless cards**
- Interact with the system without needing an app or account

Totems are ideal for guest users and tourists and support inclusive access for non-digital users.

## üõ†Ô∏è Using the Totem (User Guide)

The usage of the totem is almost entirely the same as [app usage](digital_payment.md), with the difference that that the zone is selected automatically based on the Totem's location. RFID contactless cards can be used for payment if the RFID reader is enabled.
