# Requirements Document

## Overview
The OPP (Online Parking Payment) system is designed to facilitate the management of parking spaces, fines, and tickets for both car drivers and controllers. 

The system will provide a user-friendly interface for car drivers to manage their vehicles, pay for parking, and receive notifications about fines and parking expirations. Controllers will have the ability to issue fines, manage parking zones, and monitor parking space occupancy.
The system will also include an admin interface for managing users and parking zones. 

The OPP system will be accessible through a web application, mobile app, and totem kiosks.

Built as a modern, cloud-native application, OPP leverages containerization, microservices architecture, and CI/CD pipelines for rapid deployment and scaling.
The system is designed to be highly available, resilient, and scalable to accommodate varying loads and future growth. The cloud-native infrastructure ensures optimal resource utilization while maintaining performance and security.
